# Action: design-generation

## Step 0: Resolve Output Paths

Before generating anything, compute and lock the output paths for this run:

```
IF incremental mode (unit is set):
  DESIGN_OUT = {SPECS_DIR}/{feature}/units/{unit}/
  DESIGN_DETAIL_OUT = {SPECS_DIR}/{feature}/units/{unit}/design/
  DECISIONS_OUT = {WORKFLOW_DIR}/{feature}/units/{unit}/
ELSE (comprehensive or no units):
  DESIGN_OUT = {SPECS_DIR}/{feature}/
  DESIGN_DETAIL_OUT = {SPECS_DIR}/{feature}/design/
  DECISIONS_OUT = {WORKFLOW_DIR}/{feature}/
```

Create the output directories if they don't exist. All file writes in this action use these resolved paths — no exceptions.

## Choose Format

- **Simple** (≤10 stories AND single domain) → compact `design.md` using `{ASSETS_DIR}/design-compact.md`
- **Complex** (11+ stories OR multiple domains) → modular `design.md` + `design/` folder

## External Resources (Conditional)

If `{STEERING_DIR}/resources.md` exists and lists available resources (not "none"):
- **Design tool**: Use design tool MCP (if available) to read component inventory, design tokens → incorporate into design/components.md
- **API specs**: Read OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas → use as basis for design/api-spec.md instead of designing from scratch
- **Design system docs**: Read referenced docs → align component naming and patterns
- **Reference implementations**: Read referenced repos → align architecture patterns
- Cite external sources in design documents

## Writing Strategy

1. Read all needed templates + input artifacts in one `readMultipleFiles` call
2. Write independent design detail files in parallel (same turn):
   - `design/components.md`, `design/data-model.md`, `design/api-spec.md` simultaneously
   - `design/integration.md`, `design/implementation.md` simultaneously
   - `design/testing-strategy.md` (if D3 includes testing choices and project ≠ prototype/no-testing)
   - `design/nfr.md` (if applicable), `design/correctness.md` (if applicable)
3. **Checkpoint after each file write**: Update manifest `artifacts.design.files` to include the just-written file and set `artifacts.design.status` to `"partial"`. This enables context recovery to skip already-written files.
4. Write `design.md` last (it references the detail files — keep it slim: Summary + Architecture + Traceability + References only)
5. After all files written, update manifest status from `"partial"` to `"draft"`

## No-Assumptions Rule

**CRITICAL**: ONLY use choices from D3. Read decisions from manifest `decisions.design` section. Fall back to reading `## Decisions Summary` from the decisions file if manifest section is missing. Do not parse the full question/answer blocks. Use `[TBD - not decided in D3]` for any missing decisions. Never assume technology choices that weren't explicitly decided.

## Load Guides Conditionally

Load ONLY the guides that apply from `{REFERENCES_DIR}/`. Do NOT read guides that don't match.

| Guide | Load When |
|---|---|
| `architecture-patterns.md` | **ALWAYS** |
| `api-design.md` | D3 includes API design choices (REST/GraphQL/gRPC) |
| `frontend-architecture.md` | D3 includes frontend framework choice |
| `mobile-architecture.md` | D3 includes mobile platform choice |
| `distributed-patterns.md` | Architecture = microservices or distributed system |
| `property-based-testing.md` | D3 PBT answer = Yes |

**Testing strategy generation**: If D3 includes any testing framework choices (unit, integration, E2E, load, API testing) AND project is not "prototype/no-testing", generate `design/testing-strategy.md` using `{ASSETS_DIR}/design-testing-strategy.md` template. Read the D3 testing answers to populate frameworks, and cross-reference `design/components.md` + `design/api-spec.md` for coverage mapping.

**SKIP all non-matching guides.** For a simple backend API project, load only `architecture-patterns.md` and `api-design.md` (~8KB instead of ~25KB).

**Stack-aware selective reading**: When loading `architecture-patterns.md` or `api-design.md`, read ONLY sections relevant to the chosen stack from D3 (e.g., for TypeScript/Express, skip Java Spring patterns and Go Gin patterns). If a guide has language-specific subsections, read only the matching one.

## Templates

- Simple: `{ASSETS_DIR}/design-compact.md` ONLY
- Complex: `{ASSETS_DIR}/design.md` + modular templates:
  - `{ASSETS_DIR}/design-components.md`
  - `{ASSETS_DIR}/design-data-model.md`
  - `{ASSETS_DIR}/design-api-spec.md`
  - `{ASSETS_DIR}/design-integration.md`
  - `{ASSETS_DIR}/design-implementation.md`
  - `{ASSETS_DIR}/design-testing-strategy.md` — ONLY if D3 includes testing choices AND project ≠ prototype/no-testing
  - `{ASSETS_DIR}/design-correctness.md` — ONLY if PBT selected
  - `{ASSETS_DIR}/nfr.md` — ONLY if NFR questions answered

## Validate

- ✅ All components, entities, endpoints, integrations designed
- ✅ All D3 choices used, no assumptions beyond D3
- ✅ Design files reference each other correctly
- ✅ Cross-references between design files are correct
- ✅ Testing strategy covers all D3 testing choices (if testing-strategy.md generated)
- ✅ Test directory structure in testing-strategy.md is consistent with implementation.md

## Update Steering

After generating design documents, update steering files with D3 decisions:

**`{STEERING_DIR}/tech.md`**: Fill "Pending D3 decisions" placeholders with actual choices. Do NOT overwrite previously settled decisions from earlier features or workflow runs.

**`{STEERING_DIR}/structure.md`**: Fill "will be defined during design phase" placeholders with actual structure from `design/implementation.md`. Do NOT overwrite previously documented structure.

Read current steering files first, preserve all existing content, update only the placeholder sections or append new entries.

## Update Manifest

- **Incremental mode**: Add `units[{unit}].artifacts.design` entry: `status: "draft"`, `timestamp`, `files` listing all generated design files. Write design decisions to `units[{unit}].decisions.design`.
- **Comprehensive mode**: Add top-level `artifacts.design` entry: `status: "draft"`, `timestamp`, `files`. Write design decisions to top-level `decisions.design`.
- Update `steering.updatedBy.tech` to include `design`
- Update `steering.updatedBy.structure` to include `design`

## Present Results

📍 Design

[Summary]

- **Architecture**: [Style]
- **Stack**: [Frontend] / [Backend] / [Database] / [Infra]
- **Components**: [X] designed

- **Integrations**: [W] defined
- **PBT Properties**: [N] (or "Skipped")
- **Testing Strategy**: [Included / Skipped]
- **NFR**: [Included / Skipped]

Artifacts at `{SPECS_DIR}/{feature}/design.md` (+ `design/` folder if complex).

---
🔲 **Your turn**:
- ✅ "proceed" — move to next phase
- ✏️ "change [what]" — request edits
- ← "back to [requirements/decomposition/foundation]" — return to a previous phase
```

**STOP and wait for approval.**

On "back to [phase]": Set current design artifact status to `"draft"`. Dispatch the named phase skill.

On approval: update manifest — **incremental mode**: set `units[{unit}].artifacts.design.status` to `"approved"`, set `units[{unit}].phase` to `"design"`, add `"design"` to `units[{unit}].completedPhases`. **Comprehensive mode**: set `artifacts.design.status` to `"approved"`, add `"design"` to `state.sharedPhases`. Append audit entry. Then auto-continue to tasks.
