# Action: design-decisions

Generate the D3 decisions file at `{WORKFLOW_DIR}/{feature}/decisions-design.md` (or `{WORKFLOW_DIR}/{feature}/units/{unit}/decisions-design.md` in incremental mode).

Analyze the **FULL SYSTEM** before generating questions — read requirements, units (if exists), context, foundation (if exists).

**Rules**:
- Always generate with blank `Answer:` fields — never pre-fill
- If user said "use recommendations" on a previous gate, that does NOT carry forward — each gate starts fresh
- **Skip questions** that foundation already answers (repo strategy, API architecture, auth approach, error format, inter-unit comms, DB strategy, shared types) — those decisions are settled. Do NOT include them in the decisions file.

Read `{REFERENCES_DIR}/technology-questions-catalog.md` (the **index file** — it lists which sub-catalogs to load), then load ONLY the relevant sub-catalogs based on context:

| Sub-Catalog | Load When |
|---|---|
| `{REFERENCES_DIR}/tech-catalog-backend.md` | **ALWAYS** (most projects have backend) |
| `{REFERENCES_DIR}/tech-catalog-frontend.md` | System has web UI |
| `{REFERENCES_DIR}/tech-catalog-mobile.md` | System has mobile app |
| `{REFERENCES_DIR}/tech-catalog-infra.md` | Cloud-deployed |
| `{REFERENCES_DIR}/tech-catalog-distributed.md` | Architecture = microservices or distributed |
| `{REFERENCES_DIR}/tech-catalog-nfr.md` | Production deployment or performance targets |

**Stack-aware filtering**: After loading catalogs, use `context-summary.stack` from the manifest to filter options. For each question, present ONLY options compatible with the detected stack:
- If stack = TypeScript → show only JS/TS-ecosystem options (Express, NestJS, Jest, Vitest, Prisma, etc.)
- If stack = Python → show only Python-ecosystem options (FastAPI, Django, pytest, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
- If stack = Java → show only JVM options (Spring Boot, JUnit, Hibernate, etc.)
- If stack = Go → show only Go options (Gin, Echo, go test, GORM, etc.)
- If stack is unknown/greenfield → show top 3-4 options per category across ecosystems

This prevents the model from presenting irrelevant choices (e.g., "Log4j" for a TypeScript project) and reduces question verbosity by ~60%.

Select 8–15 questions total based on project complexity.

**MANDATORY**: Include the Correctness & Property-Based Testing question.

Read `{PLATFORM_DIR}/skills/aidlc/shared/decision-gate.md` for the output structure.

Present the decision file:

```
📍 Design: Decision Gate D3

- **Decisions**: [X] questions covering stack, data, auth, testing, infrastructure

📝 Open `{WORKFLOW_DIR}/{feature}/decisions-design.md`, fill answers, say "done"
🤖 Or say "use recommendations" to auto-fill with recommended options

---
🔲 **Your turn**:
- ✏️ Fill answers in the file and say "done"
- 🤖 "use recommendations" — auto-fill recommended options for THIS gate
```

**STOP — do NOT continue. Do NOT fill answers yourself, even if choices seem obvious. Wait for user to say "done" or "use recommendations".**

When user says "done" or "use recommendations":
- If "use recommendations": fill all answers with the recommended option, update the Decisions Summary section
- Proceed to validation

---

# Action: validate-d3

After D3 answers are filled, validate for conflicts.

**Validation Process**:
1. Parse all answers from the decisions file (read Decisions Summary section)
2. Load context from manifest `context-summary` (teamSize, complexity, impact) and context.md
3. Check ONLY the relevant rule sets below based on D3 answer categories
4. Collect conflicts, adjust severity by context
5. If conflicts found → present grouped by severity (🔴 High → 🟡 Medium → 🟢 Low), ask for resolution
6. If clean or all resolved → write decision summary to manifest `decisions.design` (compact key-value pairs from Decisions Summary section) → proceed to generation

**Load validation rules from `{REFERENCES_DIR}/validation-rules-d3.md`** — read only the relevant sections based on D3 answer categories:
- **Foundation Consistency** → if `state.mode` = `incremental` AND `foundation` in `state.sharedPhases`
- **Technology Compatibility** → if D3 includes technology stack choices
- **Architecture & Performance** → if D3 includes architecture patterns or performance targets
- **Security** → if D3 includes security choices, PII/compliance, or frontend+backend combinations
- **Workflow & Cost** → if D3 includes repo strategy, CI/CD, observability, or cost-sensitive infrastructure

**Context-Based Severity Adjustments**:
- **Team Size**: Small (1–3) → complexity conflicts severity UP; Large (9+) → DOWN
- **Scope**: MVP → over-engineering severity UP; Enterprise → under-engineering severity UP
- **Timeline**: Urgent (<3mo) → complexity severity UP; Long-term (>6mo) → DOWN

**Conflict presentation**:
```
⚠️ Decision Validation — Conflicts Detected

## 🔴 Conflict 1: [Name] (High)
**Issue**: [Description]
**Your choices**: [Decision A]: [answer], [Decision B]: [answer]
**Options**: 1. [option] 2. [option] 3. Keep current (requires justification)
**Question**: How would you like to resolve this?
```

After resolution, append validation notes to the decisions file and proceed.

User can say "skip validation and proceed" → log in audit, add warning, proceed.
